## Abstract
### Background
Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a complex syndrome characterized by heterogeneity in patient presentations and poor response to traditional heart failure therapies. This study investigates the utility of clustering algorithms to identify distinct phenotypic clusters among patients with unexplained dyspnea who do not meet the HFpEF diagnostic criteria.

### Objective
To explore the heterogeneity within HFpEF by employing unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify distinct patient subgroups and assess their clinical relevance.

### Methods
The study analyzed data from 511 patients who underwent bicycle echocardiography. Various clustering algorithms, including K-means, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), and DBSCAN, were applied to a set of 26 clinical variables. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using the Gap statistic. The clusters were compared based on their characteristics and outcomes.

### Results
The analysis identified significant differences in clustering variables and two outcome variables, suggesting distinct phenotypic clusters. K-means with three clusters emerged as the most stable method. However, survival analysis showed no significant differences between the clusters in the cardiovascular outcome mortality or urgent rehospitalization, indicating that the clusters differ in baseline characteristics but not in long-term risks.

### Conclusion
Clustering can effectively differentiate patient characteristics in HFpEF, highlighting its potential as a tool for exploring heterogeneity within patients. However, no differences in mortality or urgent rehospitalization were found. The clustering results should be viewed as a preliminary step for more detailed investigations. The findings underscore the need for continued research to define phenotypic clusters and enhance personalized management strategies in HFpEF.
